# Learning Coroutine in Android

In this repository you can find the source code for the blog series on medium.

I have structured this repository using git branch. Every blog refers to a specific branch. e.g. Every code showed in the Coroutine basic blog post are available in the basic branch.

##### The mapping of blog posts and git branches are given below:
1. Coroutine Basic -> branch basic 
2. Coroutine with LiveData -> livedata
3. Coroutine with Retrofit -> retrofit
4. Coroutine with Room Database -> room
5. Coroutine with Workmanager -> workmanager
